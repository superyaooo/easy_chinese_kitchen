A cooking website I'm working on.



A jQuery plugin "dotdotdot" is used on the website homepage.
On the individual recipe page, a "back to top" button written in jQuery is used.


The CRUD admin page is based on the admin page of the BrokenToyStory blog, but
with improved code and added functions.
